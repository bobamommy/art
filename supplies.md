## Paper

Almost every watercolor artist I know has said that paper quality is the *most* important thing when it comes to creating beautiful pieces.

While it's true that you'll get better results with better paper, if you're just starting out I think it's more important to use watercolor paper that you'll enjoy practicing on, whether that's a sketchbook, student grade paper, or premium artist grade paper. Some people I know (myself included) only use nice paper for finished pieces, and that's totally okay! You need to figure out what works for you and your budget.

- **Best all round**: [Cason XL Watercolor paper](https://amzn.to/2ZQDz6v)

  One of the best student grade papers I have tried. Great value for money.
  
- **Everyday sketchbook**: [Canson XL Mixed Media Sketchbook](https://amzn.to/32QPrHP)
  
  A cheaper and lighter alternative watercolor paper, I use this for practice sketches with light washes or testing new colors and blends. 
  
- **Splurge**: [Arches Cold Press](https://amzn.to/32QPrHP)
  
  Beautiful 100% cotton paper which makes for smooth blends. This is a watercolor block, which means that the paper is glued down and won't warp while painting. Gently loosen the top sheet with a letter opener or butter knife when your finished painting is dry.

## Paintbrushes

I fell down the rabbithole of paintbrushes when I first started watercolor painting. I experimented with several brands, synthetic and non-synthetic, different shapes and sizes. What I've learned is that what brush to use depends on what you like to paint. I love painting loose florals with thirsty, synthetic squirrel hair brushes. For more detailed work, I prefer stiffer, smaller brushes. 

- **My favorite brushes**: Silver Brush Black Velvet

  This is a blend of natural squirrel hairs and synthetic hairs. The brushes hold a lot of water, and come to an extremely fine point. The shape of the brush head allows for a nice feathering effect when I paint loose florals.

- **Good value**: Princeton Neptune

  Princeton brushes are synthetic squirrel brushes, and they hold a lot of water. They're great for juicy splashes of colors. The Neptune round brushes are cut into a rounder, wider shape than the Black Velvet brushes, so I feel like it's harder to draw fine lines with these, but the value for money can't be beat.
